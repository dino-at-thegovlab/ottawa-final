     <p>Crowdsourcing uses communications technologies to enable institutions to leverage the wisdom of the crowd. 
     With crowdsourcing, organizations can get help, for example, with performing tasks, obtaining ideas and opinions, 
     gathering data, soliciting funds, or administering programs. By enabling institutions to get more distributed and 
     diverse collaboration in ways never before possible, they can improve a project’s efficiency, legitimacy and diversity. </p>
